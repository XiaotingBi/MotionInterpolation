# MotionInterpolation
Implemented human motion interpolation scheme by C++ and OpenGL using 4 algorithems separately: Linear-Euler, Bezier-Euler, Linear Quaternion and Bezier-Quaternion.

Among these four interpolation methods, Bezier-Quaternion gives the best result, and Linear-Euler method gives the worst result.
However, Bezier-Quaternion takes more time to generate the sequences.
